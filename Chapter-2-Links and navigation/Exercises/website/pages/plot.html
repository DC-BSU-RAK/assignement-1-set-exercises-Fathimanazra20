        <h1>Plot Overview</h1>
        <p>Nevermore Academy isn't your typical boarding school, and Wednesday Addams is far from a typical student. Sent there after a chaotic incident, Wednesday finds herself in a world of emerging psychic abilities and hidden dangers. As a monstrous killer stalks the town, Wednesday's unique perspective and developing powers make her the prime investigator. But the mystery runs deeper than she imagined, entwining her with a supernatural secret that has haunted her family for 25 years. Can Wednesday uncover the truth before it's too late, or will the shadows of the past consume her?.</p>
