    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric powder, chili powder, and salt. Mix well, ensuring all pieces are coated. Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until it's browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Saut√© the Onion:</strong> In the same skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the finely chopped onion and cook until it turns golden brown, about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Tomatoes and Simmer:</strong> Pour in the crushed tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing the tomatoes to reduce slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Simmer with Cream:</strong> Return the cooked chicken to the skillet. Pour in the heavy cream, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly and the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Stir well to combine. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with rice or naan bread.</li>
    </ol>
